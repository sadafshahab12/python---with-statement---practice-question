### return statement example
Imagine you have a lemonade stand, and your friend asks you to make them a cup of lemonade.

You Make the Lemonade
You take a cup, add some lemonade, and stir it up. Now, you have a yummy cup of lemonade ready for your friend.

You Give the Lemonade Back
When you say "return" in programming, it's like handing the cup of lemonade back to your friend. You're giving them what they asked for!

You Can't Do Anything Else After Returning
When you hand the lemonade back, you can't do anything else with it. You can't add more sugar or stir it again. You're done!
